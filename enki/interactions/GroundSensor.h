	//! A ground infrared sensor
	/*! \ingroup interaction

	This sensor scans the intensity of a 2x2 cm square on the ground.
	It does 9x9 measurements, using a Gaussian model with a given spatialSd standard deviation,
	and a noiseSd Gaussian measurement error.

	The resulted value v is transformed into a noiseless value finalNoiseless:

		finalNoiseless = sigm(v - cFactor, sFactor) * mFactor + aFactor

	where sigm(x, s) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x * s))

	Which is then transformed into a noise finalValue by applying Gaussian noise with noiseSd standard deviation.
