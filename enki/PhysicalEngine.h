	\section intro Introduction
	This is the reference for the Enki simulator library. Enki is a fast 2D simulator
	designed to support the simulation of colonies of robots hundred times faster
	than real time. To achieve this, simplified 2D physics and optimised hierarchical
	interaction models are used.
	
	\section installation Installation
	The installation procedure is explained step by step in the \ref InstallGuide.
	
	\section usage Usage
	A quick start to most important classes is given in the \ref Cookbook.
	
	If you want to extend Enki, do not forget to read and follow the \ref CodingConventions.
	
	\section designChoices Design choices
	The basic datatype is double. It is used everywhere excepted if another datatype
	specifically makes sense.
	
	The core concept in Enki is the interaction. An interaction can be local, i.e. apply only up to a
	certain range, or global, i.e. apply to the whole world.
	
	Local interactions are object <-> object
	and called by the inner simulation loop only when objects are below the interaction range.
	In objects, local interactions are sorted from long to short range so that once one is out
	of range, the following will be too. This is the main optimization in Enki that permits large
	colonies of robots. The complexity is still O(n2) so if very large colonies are required, a larger
	scale, grid based optimization should be used. It is currently not implemented in Enki.
	Physical dynamics between objects are the shortest ranged local interactions.
	Local interactions can also interact with walls. Physical dynamics between objects and walls are
	similar to local interactions with other objects, but use a different method of calculation.
	
	Global interactions are object <-> world.
	
	\section state Development state
	
	The core, the IRSensor, and the basic Khepera, EPuck, Alice and Sbot features reflect real hardware and thus won't change much.
	
	The sound sources of Sbot does not reflect directly hardware and thus is subject to change.
	
	\section feedback Feedback
	If you have any comments or suggestions, do not hesitate to send them to
